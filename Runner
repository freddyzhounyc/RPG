/*
This is an RPG. This is kind of based off of pokemon and the charactes of pokemon where there are options that you can
choose from such as attacking, using an item, etc. There are a total of 5 options in this game, but there is no running
away so you have to be able to beat them or you get beat. You have 5 total pokemons and the opponent has 5 pokemons that
they have and they are the same each time you play the game, and they get increasingly harder and harder as you beat
each of the pokemons. You will be able to heal youself, you will be able to increase your mana, and many other options.
There are many features that I attempted to include in this project as I have tried to include a health inventory and
a item inventory where the health inventory has all the possible ways to increase your health such as a health pot and
the item inventory has all the possible ways to increase your mana value such as the mana pot. I have also tried to implement
a critical hit or a special attack move where there is a 1/10 chance where you can hit it and completely destroy the oponent, but
there is a great chance that you may not hit it so you can either take the risk, or you can use a regular attack, but it
is all up to the player and if you do not get the critical hit, you will be punished by having some mana points taken away
from the player.
